# The following line disables the default queries. This is used because we want to enable on query at a time by
# explicitly specifying each query in a "queries" array as they are enabled.

# We must specify a query for CodeQL to run. Until the first query is enabled, enable the security query suite but
# exclude all problem levels from impacting the results. After the first query is enabled, this filter can be relaxed
# to find the level of problems desired from the query.
